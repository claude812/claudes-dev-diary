<head><h1>Claude's Dev Diary</h1></head>
<h2>Update 1(Wednesday the 5th of Febuary)</h2>
<h3>I joined my group today.The people i joined were Mick Lawlor,Darragh Griffin,Warda Abbasi, Sean Nealon, Sania Malik, Corey Bowden, Martina Dumas Gonz√°lez Iszcaray.
we went through a couple of ideas in a meeting in the library and also got to know each other and qualties we could bring to the group. We all decided from the start we wanted from the start that we wanted to do a horrer game.
</h3>
<h2>Update 2 (Saturday the 8th Febuary )</h2>
<h3>We had our second meeting yesterday and we decided on an idea. We decided on a horror game based in an carnival. We decided for gameplay that it would be multiple minigames and that we would do it in 3D.I was nervous to do 3D for the game but some of the others in the group were confident in our abilty to do it in 3D so i decided it would be a great learning experience. </h3>

<h2>Update 3 (Monday Febuary 10th)</h2>
<h3>We had a meeting today where we decided to implement an idea that Mick had in the previous meeting which was to make the minigames with a bit of a twist like the movie Saw.</h3>
<h2>Update 4(Friday 14th Febuary)</h2>
<h3>Today Warda our producer decided to divide up the minigames. We decided to have two people per mini game. I was grouped with Mick Lawlor and we were tasked with doing the ski ball minigame.<p>The other groups were as follows:</p><p> Pitch Document-Archie,Sean and Darragh</p>
           <p> Can toss-Sean and Warda</p>
            <p>Ring toss-Sania,Corey.</p>
We still have more minigames to code but we want to get 3 done first and then try to get the rest done.  </h3>

<h2>Update 5 ( Friday 28th Febuary)</h2>
<h3>I've made a huge start on the code for the first minigame and it was way harder than i couldve expected. Theres no tutorials for the specific game i am making (Skee ball) and i've never coded a game before so it has been a struggle.I've watched s many tutorials for diffrent mechanics that my whole home page nearly is coding videos. I will have some of the videos i have used listed at the bottom of this update. Finding good tutorials for specific aspects of the game is challenging to say the least.I also went with Mick to ask Gavin Wade if we should reduce the amount of minigames and he said that the games should start quicker. This because we were going to have 3 blocks of minigames but he thought it would be better to have the first block have 2 and then add a fourth to the midde column. Making the game in 3D was also way harder than i ever couldve expected and i've found is really reduced the amount of videos explaining how to do certain things.It does make me worry that i won't be able to finish everything i wanted to do in time so i feel like i will have to talk to people n the group about that.
    <p>These are links to some videos i found usefull</p>

<h2>Update 6 (Wednesday 12th March)</h2>
<h3>I had midterms in two modules last done now and i have  a maths one in week 8 so progression in the game slowed down as i had not done enough work for those modules especially for maths next week.All though this has been a set back i have learnt to be more time efficient and to get work done quicker. I have the code done now so i wil send it to my partner for this minigame Mick to see if it works. This will be the first test so i will be expecting a few bugs from it. Also Mick shared my concern about the timeline of the game so in one of the labs we went up to Gavin Wade and asked about the importance of finishing this game for our gade as getting a good grade in this module is important to us.We also asked him if we should reduce the amount of minigames and he said that the games should start quicker. This because we were going to have 3 blocks of minigames but he thought it would be better to have the first block have 2 and then add a fourth to the midde column.We're planning on testing the code next week after our maths test and hopefully it works but if not i will try to fix it after that.</h3>
